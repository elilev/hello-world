Just another repository

Over the past two years I have been a digital designer at Moovit, the worldâ€™s largest public transit app. my position entailed working with a team to create a product that serves 35 Million users, in over 800 cities around the globe. creating a large scale global brand that effects millions of users, has expanded my ability to take multiple types of projects all the way from the conceptualisation stage into a high end execution, while understanding the objective and the big picture.
